## Setup the Project

Follow the below mentioned steps to setup the dev environment:
1. Fork this Repository
2. Clone your fork locally
```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/sodium-ui.git
cd sodium-ui
```
3. Install all the development dependencies for your project via npm.
```

```
4. To visualize the UI components and to test the behaviour, **Sodium-UI** uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). To setup storybook, run
```
// using npm
npm run storybook

// or using yarn
yarn storybook
```
This will open Storybook at https://localhost:6006

5. Once done with the changes, to test the working of the library, first bundle using [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/). Run
```
npm run build-sodium
```
6. You can use ```npm link``` to test the library in your local machine. 
7. After the appropriate testing and development of the feature/bug you resolved, feel free to make a PR. We will be happy to review it ASAP.
